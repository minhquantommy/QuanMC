Subject: [PATCH] Add CommandLine EULA Flag

This flag contains the same message as eula.txt (albeit with proper grammar for 3rd person plural). By setting this flag you are agreeing to the terms listed in the message printed upon setting this flag, which are no different from those agreed to by any other method.

This feature only exists for hosting companies and people who manage servers in bulk who wish to agree to the terms by setting a flag in a script.
